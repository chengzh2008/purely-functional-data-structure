{-
  Two invariants for red-black tree:
  1. No red node has red child
  2. Every path from the root to an empty node contains the same number of black nodes.

  Together, these two invariants guarantee that the longest possible path in a red-black tree, one with alternating black and red nodes, is no more than twice as long as the shortest possible path, one with black nodes only.

-- Exercise 3.8 Prove that the maximum depth of a node in a red-black tree of size n is at most 2* floor(log(n + 1)).
